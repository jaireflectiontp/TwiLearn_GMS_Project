## Membership Invoice:

The membership invoice is dynamically generated, capturing details such as the type of membership chosen by the member, the specified duration, and the selected diet plan type. The modal elegantly presents comprehensive user details alongside the relevant billing information for a seamless and informative invoicing experience.

In the diet plan section, I implemented four distinct plans, allowing users to seamlessly toggle and view the weekly plan associated with each plan type.
